* For merchants operating in the e-commerce market and eventually receiving fraudulent transactions, Velocity Check is a product that will identify suspected fraud behavior.  

* The tool is intended to assist in fraud analysis at a much lower cost than a more traditional market tool. It is an ally in the evaluation of suspect buying behavior, since the calculations will be based on variables contained in the various rules created to be triggered in the analysis.  

* Velocity Check can be enabled for clients that are integrated into the Pagador API SOAP or the Pagador API REST.
